# Implementation details

## Orthogonalization
To denote a basis of vectors, e.g. to represent a given Krylov subspace, there is an
abstract type `Basis{T}`
```@docs
KrylovKit.Basis
```

Many Krylov based algorithms use an orthogonal basis to parameterize the Krylov subspace. In
that case, the specific implementation `OrthonormalBasis{T}` can be used:
```@docs
KrylovKit.OrthonormalBasis
```

We can orthogonalize or orthonormalize a given vector to another vector (assumed normalized)
or to a given [`KrylovKit.OrthonormalBasis`](@ref) using
```@docs
KrylovKit.orthogonalize
KrylovKit.orthonormalize
```
or using the possibly in-place versions
```@docs
KrylovKit.orthogonalize!!
KrylovKit.orthonormalize!!
```

The expansion coefficients of a general vector in terms of a given orthonormal basis can be obtained as
```@docs
KrylovKit.project!!
```
whereas the inverse calculation is obtained as
```@docs
KrylovKit.unproject!!
```

An orthonormal basis can be transformed using a rank-1 update using
```@docs
KrylovKit.rank1update!
```

Note that this changes the subspace. A mere rotation of the basis, which does not change
the subspace spanned by it, can be computed using

```@docs
KrylovKit.basistransform!
```

## Block Krylov method
The block version of the Krylov subspace algorithm is an approach to extending Krylov subspace techniques from single starting vectors to multiple starting vectors. It is mainly used for solving linear systems with degenerate dominant eigenvalues.

In our implementation, the multiple-vector data structure is BlockVec, which implements the [`KrylovKit.abstract_qr!`](@ref), [`KrylovKit.block_reorthogonalize!`](@ref), and [`KrylovKit.compute_residual!`](@ref) interfaces.

```@docs
KrylovKit.BlockVec
```

A block of vectors can be orthonormalized using
```@docs
KrylovKit.abstract_qr!
```
This apply QR decomposition to a block of vectors using modified Gram-Schmidt process.

Additional procedures applied to the block are as follows:
```@docs
KrylovKit.block_reorthogonalize!
KrylovKit.compute_residual!
```



## Dense linear algebra

KrylovKit relies on Julia's `LinearAlgebra` module from the standard library for most of its
dense linear algebra dependencies.

## Factorization types
The central ingredient in a Krylov based algorithm is a Krylov factorization or
decomposition of a linear map. Such partial factorizations are represented as a
`KrylovFactorization`, of which `LanczosFactorization`, `BlockLanczosFactorization` and `ArnoldiFactorization` are three
concrete implementations:

```@docs
KrylovKit.KrylovFactorization
KrylovKit.LanczosFactorization
KrylovKit.BlockLanczosFactorization
KrylovKit.ArnoldiFactorization
KrylovKit.GKLFactorization
```

A `KrylovFactorization` or `GKLFactorization` can be destructured into its defining
components using iteration, but these can also be accessed using the following functions
```@docs
basis
rayleighquotient
residual
normres
rayleighextension
```

As the `rayleighextension` is typically a simple basis vector, we have created a dedicated
type to represent this without having to allocate an actual vector, i.e.
```@docs
KrylovKit.SimpleBasisVector
```

Furthermore, to store the Rayleigh quotient of the Arnoldi factorization in a manner that
can easily be expanded, we have constructed a custom matrix type to store the Hessenberg
matrix in a packed format (without zeros):

```@docs
KrylovKit.PackedHessenberg
```

## Factorization iterators
Given a linear map ``A`` and a starting vector ``x₀``, a Krylov factorization is obtained
by sequentially building a Krylov subspace ``{x₀, A x₀, A² x₀, ...}``. Rather then using
this set of vectors as a basis, an orthonormal basis is generated by a process known as
Lanczos, BlockLanczos or Arnoldi iteration (for symmetric/hermitian and for general matrices,
respectively). These processes are represented as iterators in Julia:

```@docs
KrylovKit.KrylovIterator
KrylovKit.LanczosIterator
KrylovKit.BlockLanczosIterator
KrylovKit.ArnoldiIterator
```

Similarly, there is also an iterator for the Golub-Kahan-Lanczos bidiagonalization proces:

```@docs
KrylovKit.GKLIterator
```

As an alternative to the standard iteration interface from Julia Base (using `iterate`),
these iterative processes and the factorizations they produce can also be manipulated
using the following functions:

```@docs
expand!
shrink!
initialize
initialize!
```
